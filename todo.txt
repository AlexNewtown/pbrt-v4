- RGB class? (eventually records primaries, etc.)

- Image::SetRGB method? Spectrum in general is sort of out of place, since
  we're explicit about "this is a 3 channel image", etc...
  - but otoh we do want to someday support spectral Images...

- how come sampler test wasn't failing on gce?

- avx 2 support, half to float, etc...  -march=native?

- ToString(), etc:
  BSSRDF
  Camera
  EFloat
  Film, FilmTile
  Filter
  fp16
  Image
  Integrator
  Interaction
  Light
  LightDistribution
  Material
  MIPMap
  ParamSetItem (refactor from ParamSet ToString())
  Primitive
  RNG
  Sampler
  Scene
  Shape
  TextureMapping*

- pbrt/src/pbrt/core -> #include <pbrt/core/pbrt.h>, #include
  <pbrt/util/half.h>, etc?

+ need to update emptychamber and villa in regress/ to use png not tga
  textures

- find interval test is broken

- pbrtAttribute: use attributes for parameter initialization backup...  can
  we pass something to the Create functions that helps abstract this?

- Scene::ForEachLight, Shape(bool expandInstances), Material, ... ?

- more tests from v3-scenes in regress

- aov integrator should include metadata

- more std::optional usage ...

- std::string_view (in many places) (absl equivalent?)

- spherical traiangle sampling (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4tGGzd)

- more tests from v3-scenes in regress

- time reported by profiling system vs progress reporter (and reported in
  stats) doesn't match... (only for short renders? need more investigation)

- try jacopo/heitz stuff for inf env map sampling e.g.

- explicit path representation (review mitsuba libbidir stuff). Also, just
  build on top of bdpt Vertex stuff?

- could get rid of a lot of annoying plumbing
  (e.g. VIsibilityTester::Unoccluded) if scene was a global

- remove black filtering mode?

- use kahan summation for accumulating into the image, not for accumulating
  into the tile!!!
  
- add test for elementary intervals on e.g. sobol arrays, just to be sure
  the array sampling isn't borked

- figure out consistent merging of film tiles so have fully deterministic
  final pixel outputs
  
- absorbing-sphere-null.pbrt gives inconsistent resutls (even with one
  thread??) (others as well...)  (Film tile merge??)

- api.cpp: Create* vs Make*, etc.

- CreateConeShape -> Cone::Create (etc..)

- api / MakeFilter error handling (exit) is inconsistent with others...
  General API error handling review. Recover and use something, or fail
  hard?
  
- test alpha tex for non triangles. also review how it's passed through for
  non-triangles in --cat/--toply

- Attribute ... std::shared_ptr<ParamSet>: Primitive/Shape, Light,
  Material, ... ?

- need tests based on more interesting scenes in v3-scenes

- params faceindices face_indices faceIndices

- alpha masking really doesn't work with area lights (do we care, or is
  this just for leaves?)
    - nuke shadowalpha: alpha can be made physical, not shadow...
   + render san miguels to see if it matters...

- do we actually use tHit at this point? (for anything besides far hit culling)

- implement improved delta/ratio tracking stuff...

- store Integrator and Camera in Scene (eliminate places where it's plumbed through)

- how come e.g. a triangle isn't xformed twice when an area light source?
  light to world versus the baked in world space xform
  
- itentity mapping3d should be called transformampping3d

- IntersectTr? only used once?

- move ray into its own header?

- texcache branch is blurring bump map lookups; see e.g. bump-sphere.pbrt.
  do side-by-side runs?  this is due to bilerp default (only partly?)

- actually do robust bvh traversal--watertight...

- manuka-style pre-dice?

- Keep a pool of FilmTiles, don't do dynamic allocation in the usual case
  (remember to zero out spectrum sums and weights when returning them)

- BxDFType is really only used for "was it specular" at this point;
  simplify?  (BSSRDFs also though...)

- pass relative IOR rather than both IORs everywhere that's possible. be
  consistent: to/from, right? 

- support animated light sources (transformation at least)

- light tree for many lights

- sampling utility routine that takes an initializer list (or array slice)
  of discrete probabilities (not necessarily normalized?) and a random
  value in [0,1], then samples one of the probabilities, then returns both
  the index of the even sampled and a renormalized to [0,1] random
  variable. Use for sort of one-off things where it's not worth building
  a full Distribution1D, or cases where it's just an a or b choice?

- direct lighting code can use a general cleanup

- FindOneFilename: support search path. also, pass it in (absl-based?)

- break out cat and toply to be separate (C++) implementations of the API,
  such that we can run it on individual files, w/o worrying about am I in a
  world block, etc...

- v3->v4 upgrade option  (cat variant)

- rename --cat to --fmt ?
