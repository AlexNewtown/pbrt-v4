- absorbing-sphere-null.pbrt gives inconsistent resutls (even with one
  thread??) (others as well...)

- CopyRect* (and throughout Image) can be simplified with some templates, a
  la

(TBD)
template <PixelFormat format, typename Op> ApplyInternal(Bounds2i b, Op op) {
        for (int v = extent.pMin[1]; v < extent.pMax[1]; ++v) {
            int offset = PixelOffset({extent.pMin[0], v}, 0);
            for (int u = 0; u < nu; ++u)
                Op(bufIter++, p8[offset++]);

- give pixelformat enum methods! (numchannels, etc.)

- v4 start up is much slower (e.g. landscape). big issue with MIP Map generation?
  - fast resampling, cache aware tiles...
  - MemoryPool stuff in parser?

- api.cpp: Create* vs Make*, etc.

- CreateConeShape -> Cone::Create (etc..)

- api / MakeFilter error handling (exit) is inconsistent with others...

- test alpha tex for non triangles. also review how it's passed through for
  non-triangles in --cat/--toply

- Attribute ... std::shared_ptr<ParamSet>: Primitive/Shape, Light,
  Material, ... ?

- need tests based on more interesting scenes in v3-scenes

- params faceindices face_indices faceIndices

- Sampler::SampleDiscrete (based on Smaple1D...)

- alpha masking really doesn't work with area lights (do we care, or is
  this just for leaves?)
    - nuke shadowalpha: alpha can be made physical, not shadow...

- do we actually use tHit at this point? (for anything besides far hit culling)

- store Integrator and Camera in Scene

- how come e.g. a triangle isn't xformed twice when an area light source?
  light to world versus the baked in world space xform
  
- itentity mapping3d should be called transformampping3d

- IntersectTr? only used once?

- move ray into its own header?

- imageio.* nuke?

- texcache branch is blurring bump map lookups; see e.g. bump-sphere.pbrt.
  do side-by-side runs?  this is due to bilerp default (only partly?)

- actually do robust bvh traversal--watertight...

- Replace NOT_ONE in HasScale with a local lambda function...

- manuka-style pre-dice?

- Keep a pool of FilmTiles, don't do dynamic allocation in the usual case
  (remember to zero out spectrum sums and weights when returning them)

- BxDFType is really only used for "was it specular" at this point;
  simplify?  (BSSRDFs also though...)

- pass relative IOR rather than both IORs everywhere that's possible. be
  consistent: to/from, right? 

- support animated light sources (transformation at least)

- light tree for many lights

- sampling utility routine that takes an initializer list (or array slice)
  of discrete probabilities (not necessarily normalized?) and a random
  value in [0,1], then samples one of the probabilities, then returns both
  the index of the even sampled and a renormalized to [0,1] random
  variable. Use for sort of one-off things where it's not worth building
  a full Distribution1D, or cases where it's just an a or b choice?

- direct lighting code can use a general cleanup

- FindOneFilename: support search path. also, pass it in (absl-based?)

- break out cat and toply to be separate (C++) implementations of the API,
  such that we can run it on individual files, w/o worrying about am I in a
  world block, etc...

- v3->v4 upgrade option  (cat variant)

- rename --cat to --fmt ?
